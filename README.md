# Analysis-of-glass-dataset-in-mlbench

The goal of the project is to conduct a full analysis of a (moderately) large dataset using the data preparation tools and ML methods. Glass dataset from mlbench package in R was choosen for our report.

**Problem statement: Whether features of glass can be used to predict the type of glass accurately and to what extent**

The ML algorithm chosen was Random Forest, and its performance was then evaluated using overall accuracy and a confusion matrix. To support analyses, the following R packages were used: caret, dplyr and reshape2, in addition to mlbench for the dataset.
